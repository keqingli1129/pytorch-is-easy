# Getting started with Distributed Training with Ray, PyTorch and DeepSpeed

## What is Distributed Training?

Distributed training enables training deep learning models across multiple GPUs or machines by parallelizing computation. The most common approach is **data parallelism**, where:

- Each GPU holds a complete copy of the model
- Training data is split across GPUs (each GPU processes different batches)
- Gradients are synchronized across all GPUs after each backward pass
- Model weights are updated identically on all GPUs

This allows training larger batches and reduces training time proportionally to the number of GPUs.

For **large models that don't fit in a single GPU's memory**, you can use:
- **FSDP2 (Fully Sharded Data Parallel)**: PyTorch's native solution for model sharding across GPUs
- **DeepSpeed ZeRO**: Microsoft's memory optimization technology that partitions optimizer states, gradients, and parameters

## PyTorch DistributedDataParallel (DDP)

[DistributedDataParallel](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html) is PyTorch's native solution for distributed training:

> DDP implements data parallelism at the module level by synchronizing gradients across processes. It uses collective communications from `torch.distributed` to coordinate gradient averaging during the backward pass.

Key characteristics:
- One process per GPU (unlike DataParallel which uses threads)
- Uses NCCL backend for efficient GPU-to-GPU communication
- Requires manual setup of process groups, distributed samplers, and multi-node coordination

## Ray Train

[Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/getting-started-pytorch.html) is a library for distributed deep learning that simplifies scaling PyTorch training:

> Ray Train handles the complexity of distributed training setup, including process management, data distribution, and checkpoint handling across workers.

Key benefits:
- Single command to scale from 1 to N GPUs
- Automatic process group initialization
- Built-in fault tolerance and checkpointing
- Seamless integration with Ray's distributed computing ecosystem

## Getting Started with Anyscale

This workshop is designed to run on [Anyscale](https://console.anyscale.com/), a managed Ray platform.

### Creating a Cluster

1. **Sign in to Anyscale Console**
   - Go to [https://console.anyscale.com/](https://console.anyscale.com/)
   - Create an account or sign in

2. **Create a new Workspace**
   - Click "Workspaces" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Create Workspace"
   - Select a compute configuration with GPUs (e.g., `g5.4xlarge` instances)
   - Choose the number of worker nodes based on your GPU requirements

3. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/debnsuma/vhol-ray-train.git
   cd vhol-ray-train
   ```

4. **Set up**

   ```bash
   
   # Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   ```

## Workshop Structure

This workshop covers distributed training from basic DDP to advanced memory optimization techniques, culminating in a real-world voice cloning project:

```

## Quick Start

### Vanilla PyTorch DDP

```bash
cd 01-ddp-pytorch-only

# Single node, 4 GPUs
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 train_ddp.py --epochs 3

# For multi-node, see the launch instructions
./launch_multinode_ddp.sh
```

### Ray Train (DDP)

```bash
cd 02-ddp-pytorch-ray

# Start with the interactive tutorial notebook
jupyter notebook Ray_Train_Intro.ipynb

# Or run the scripts directly
python train_ray_ddp.py --num-workers 2 --epochs 3

# With Ray Data for distributed preprocessing
python train_ray_ddp_with_ray_data.py --num-workers 2 --epochs 3
```

### FSDP2 and DeepSpeed

For training large models that don't fit in a single GPU's memory:

```bash
cd 03-fsdp-pytorch-ray-deepspeed

# Start with FSDP2 tutorial (PyTorch native)
jupyter notebook FSDP2_RayTrain_Tutorial.ipynb

# Then try DeepSpeed (Microsoft's ZeRO technology)
jupyter notebook DeepSpeed_RayTrain_Tutorial.ipynb
```

### Voice Cloning with Qwen3-TTS

Apply everything you've learned to fine-tune a 1.7B parameter TTS model:

```bash
cd 04-qwen3-tts-ft-ray

# Run the complete pipeline
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --all --num-epochs 10

# Or zero-shot voice cloning (no fine-tuning needed)
python scripts/zero_shot_clone.py \
    --ref-audio samples/voice.wav \
    --text "Hello, this is my cloned voice." \
    --output output.wav
```

# Project Portfolio Summary

My technical work demonstrates a strong command of applied deep learning across diverse domains, ranging from assistive technology to astrophysics. As a WAICY 2024 finalist, I developed a specialized neural network for American Sign Language (ASL) recognition, engineering a computer vision system capable of interpreting dynamic hand gestures to facilitate accessible communication. Building on this expertise in neural architectures, I approached the NASA Development Challenge by designing a model to process vast open datasets, successfully automating the detection of exoplanet signatures through advanced pattern recognition in astronomical data.
